Arduino RC522 NFC Reader PCB Board

This is just a plain board that connects a RC522 board with an Arduino Nano.

This project was made out of frustration due to wiring the RC522 board with an Arduino Nano every time I wanted to use it.

# Making this yourself
Simply download the gerber files and upload them to a PCB manufacturer.

I'd recommend JLCPCB as they're cheap and have good quality. I've used them for this project and they turned out great.

# Flashing the Arduino Nano
Download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Upload the example code in the repo: https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid
